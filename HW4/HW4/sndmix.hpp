 This program reads all sound files passed as arguments, and “mixes” them into a single sound file. 
 The program is invoked as
        sndmix [switches] mult1 file1 ...multn filen
 where the sample data of filei is multiplied by multi (a real value between -10 and 10); the scaled data is summed to produce the output file.
 
 SWITCHES
 1) -h : Shows the help screen
 2) -o file : specify the output file name; if omitted, write to standard output.
