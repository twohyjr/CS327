 -----------BONUS PROBLEM!!!!----------
 
 (15 points)
 This program adds sound effects to a specified sound file.
 The idea is to add sound processing to an existing sound file.
 It is your job to design the user commandline interface similar to the other programs in the assignment.
 The idea behind this program is given an input soundfile, the user can addon (in order) several sound effects. 
 You may choose the effects you add.
 Examples are backwards, reverb, echo, pitchup, pitchdown, fadeinout.
 In addition, effects may have parameters that are dependent on the type of effect.
 An example of using this program may result in: reverse the samples, add reverb (with appropriate paramters), reverse the samples, followed echo (with appropriate parameters).
 Note that this is a real nice place to use a decorator pattern.
