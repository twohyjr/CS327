 (15 points)
 This program reads all sound files passed as arguments, and writes a single sound file that is the concatenation of the inputs.
 If no files are passed as arguments, then the program should read from standard input.
 Note that there are situations that make it hard to concatenate sound files such as ones with different numbers of channels.
 You must choose how to resolve these types of situations. One way here is to convert each sound to the maximum number of channels of any sound file, or simply give an error to the user.
 
 SWITCHES
 
 1) -h : Shows the help screen
 2) -o file : specify the output file name; if omitted, write to standard output.
 3) -w : optionally for bonus points output in .wav format instead of .cs229 format.
